<h1>To the Eccedentesiast</h1>
<hr/>
<p>No small talk,no formalities.<br>
Let everything out. <br>
Tell me what made you cry? The reason behind the hesitation in your smile, <br>
The thoughts that keep you awake every night, <br>
Send me paragraphs about the beach you love visting,  <br>
The happy and not so happy memories of your childhood, <br>
Don't fret,pour your heart out, <br>
And I promise I will listen to you for hours, <br>
I will hang on to each word you say,  <br>
Let us together listen to the sorrows of the world,the reason behind the chaos, <br>
Let's make this life worthwhile to live. <br>
