Twenty seconds of courage, <br>
Twenty seconds of mind over matter, <br>
Twenty seconds of listening to your heart,  <br>
Twenty seconds of living your dream <br>
That is all you need to change your life.  <br>
Cause darling,that is what life is all about, <br>
It's about how you see the ups and downs,  <br>
It's about living your passion, <br>
It's about discovering  yourself,  <br>
Remind yourself how incredibly beautiful the world is and it's ok to be empty,  <br>
Let your hair down,  <br>
Enjoy the small moments, <br>
Smile a little more, <br>
Laugh more, <br>
Live and love each moment of your life, <br>
The dots will connect,  <br>
At the end of the day,all you want to do is to look back and say, <br>
It was a great life!. <br>
