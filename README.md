# To the Eccedentesiast

No small talk,no formalities.
Let everything out.
Tell me what made you cry? The reason behind the hesitation in your smile,
The thoughts that keep you awake every night,
Send me paragraphs about the beach you love visting,
The happy and not so happy memories of your childhood,
Don't fret,pour your heart out,
And I promise I will listen to you for hours,
I will hang on to each word you say,
Let us together listen to the sorrows of the world,the reason behind the chaos,
Let's make this life worthwhile to live.
